## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Worktree coupling

The system SHALL create `_v-<slug>` worktrees below the resolved `variant.root` with `git worktree add` in the resolved `variant.main` when variant operations require it, and reuse one that exists. Variant operations SHALL NOT change the working directory of the process. A new worktree SHALL start a branch named with the first of `variant.branchPrefixes` from `variant.baseBranch`, unless a branch named with any configured prefix already exists, which SHALL be checked out instead. When the root is the main tree or lies inside it and a `.gitignore` exists there, creating a worktree SHALL add the line `<prefix>*` (for example `_v-*`) to that `.gitignore` unless a line already ignores it (`<prefix>*` or `/<prefix>*`, with or without a trailing `/`; a comment does not count). The system SHALL NOT create a `.gitignore` and SHALL NOT change one when the root is outside the main tree.

#### Scenario: Ensure worktree on create
- **WHEN** `create("add-auth")` is called from the primary worktree
- **THEN** `_v-add-auth` is created on `feat/add-auth` below the resolved root and the result holds its path
- **AND** the working directory of the process is unchanged

#### Scenario: Main slug stays in primary
- **WHEN** the slug resolves to `main`
- **THEN** no worktree is created and the process stays in the primary checkout

#### Scenario: Worktree uses resolved variant root
- **WHEN** `create("add-auth")` requires a worktree and `variant.root` resolves to `/workspace`
- **THEN** the worktree path is `/workspace/_v-add-auth`

#### Scenario: Worktree created from the main tree
- **WHEN** `variant.main` is `/work/app`, the process runs in `/elsewhere`, and `create("add-auth")` requires a worktree
- **THEN** the worktree is added to the repository of `/work/app`

#### Scenario: Watch from the repository with the workspace layout
- **WHEN** `watch("foo")` runs from `/work/app` and `/work/AGENTS.md` is a symlink into it
- **THEN** the worktree `/work/_v-foo` is created on `feat/foo` from `variant.baseBranch`

#### Scenario: Configured base branch and prefix
- **WHEN** `variant.baseBranch` is `develop`, `variant.branchPrefixes` is `["task/"]` and `create("add-auth")` requires a worktree
- **THEN** branch `task/add-auth` is created from `develop`

#### Scenario: Existing branch with another configured prefix
- **WHEN** `variant.branchPrefixes` is `["feat/", "fix/"]` and branch `fix/add-auth` already exists
- **THEN** the worktree checks out `fix/add-auth`

#### Scenario: Worktree inside the main tree is git-ignored
- **WHEN** the root is the main tree, its `.gitignore` exists without an entry for `_v-*`, and a worktree is created
- **THEN** `.gitignore` ends with the line `_v-*`

#### Scenario: Ignore entry already present
- **WHEN** the root is the main tree and its `.gitignore` already has the line `_v-*` (or `/_v-*`)
- **THEN** `.gitignore` is unchanged, also after a second worktree is created

#### Scenario: No gitignore file
- **WHEN** the root is the main tree and no `.gitignore` exists
- **THEN** none is created

#### Scenario: Worktree outside the main tree
- **WHEN** the root is the directory that holds the main tree
- **THEN** no `.gitignore` is changed
