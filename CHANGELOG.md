# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Removed

- **BREAKING** The `switch` command: the `variant switch` CLI command, the `variant_switch` MCP tool,
  `client.switch()` and the `switchWorktree` export. It only changed the working directory of the process
  that ran it. `create` still ensures the `_v-*` worktree and returns its path.

## 0.0.1

### Added

- Shared `variant-config` package for YAML and mise/environment discovery.
- `variant-api` lifecycle client and `variant` CLI.
- `variant-mcp` tools for database variant operations.
